# UnityPrototypePlayground
This repository is a heavily-documented set of basic prototypes that can be used as examples to understand unity mechanics or to build off of

## Repo Structure
The general idea behind this repo as a whole is to keep and maintain a collection of completely disjoint set of prototype mini-projects. Separated in sub-folders of different mechanics, each collection should have a parent folder and reference nothing outside it's parent folder. This will make it perfectly clear what is needed in order for a certain mechanic to work and nothing more complex than that.
